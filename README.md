# Test framework in Cypress v12.2.0 for AutomationTestStore
Hi! Here are tests that i've created and still creating new for: https://automationteststore.com/
# How to run my tests
First, You need to install all packages
```bash
npm install
```
Then, You should just run my cypress tests with:
```bash
npx cypress open
```

Or basicly with terminal just:
```bash
npx cypress run
```
